# Object Detection Project

A simple object detection system built with **Edge Impulse** and **YOLO (MobileNetV1)**.  
It allows you # Object Detection Project

A simple object detection system built with **Edge Impulse** and **YOLO (MobileNetV1)**.  
It allows you to capture and label images using a mobile device, train a lightweight model with transfer learning, and deploy it back to your phone for **real-time detection**.

## 🔑 Features
- Mobile data collection and labeling  
- YOLO + MobileNetV1 transfer learning  
- On-device, real-time detection  
- Easy deployment with Edge Impulse  

---

## 🌍 Applications
- Smart Homes – gesture or object-based automation  
- Retail & Inventory – product tracking and stock management  
- Security & Surveillance – detect people, vehicles, or items  
- Traffic Monitoring – identify vehicles and pedestrians  
- Education – interactive object recognition tools

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Connect your phone to Edge Impulse via QR code  
2. Capture and label images (50+ per object recommended)  
3. Preprocess and train using transfer learning (YOLO + MobileNetV1)  
4. Test the model and deploy it back to your phone  
5. Run live detection on the device camera
